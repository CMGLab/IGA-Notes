# IGA-Notes

These are the notes for the course "Isogeometric Methods", taught for the first time at the University of Colorado Boulder in Fall 2014.  The notes are fairly self-contained, though they are meant to complement the following textbook:

J.A. Cottrell, T.J.R. Hughes, Y. Bazilevs, "Isogeometric Analysis: Toward Integration of CAD and FEA", John Wiley and Sons, 2009

A student should be able to implement their first very first single-patch NURBS isogeometric codes for heat conduction, linear elasticity, linear elastodynamics, nonlinear elastodynamics, and incompressible flow following these notes.  Detailed pseudo-code is provided for each of the following applications.

A number of homework assignments is also included in this repository.  These assignments are described below.

Homework 1: In this assignment, a student builds a set of algorithms for evaluating NURBS basis functions and NURBS curves and surfaces.  This homework covers Chapters 1-9 from the "Isogeometric Methods" notes.

Homework 2: In this assignment, a student builds a set of algorithms for extracting a NURBS geometry.  This homework covers Chapter 10 from the "Isogeometric Methods" notes.

Homework 3: In this assignment, a student builds a single-patch NURBS isogeometric code for heat conduction.  This homework covers Chapters 12-18 from the "Isogeometric Methods" notes.

Homework 4: In this assignment, a student builds a single-patch NURBS isogeometric code for linear elasticity.  This homework covers Chapters 19-26 from the "Isogeometric Methods" notes.

Homework 5: In this assignment, a student builds single-patch NURBS isogeometric codes for structural dynamics, wave propagation, and elastodynamics.  This homework covers Chapters 27-31 from the "Isogeometric Methods" notes.
