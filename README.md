# IGA-Notes

These are the notes for the course "Isogeometric Methods", taught for the first time at the University of Colorado Boulder in Fall 2014.  The notes are fairly self-contained, though they are meant to complement the following textbook:

J.A. Cottrell, T.J.R. Hughes, Y. Bazilevs, "Isogeometric Analysis: Toward Integration of CAD and FEA", John Wiley and Sons, 2009

A student should be able to implement their first very first single-patch NURBS isogeometric codes for heat conduction, linear elasticity, linear elastodynamics, nonlinear elastodynamics, and incompressible flow following these notes.  Detailed pseudo-code is provided for each of the following applications.
